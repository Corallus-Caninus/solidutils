        build sequential/parallel array of cyclone filters in a cartesian grid pattern.
        starts by fitting width with init_params cycloneFilter objects, then alters geometry by delta_params 
        (currently can only functionally decrease parameters)and adds the equivalent airflow; 
        through each sequence of delta_params the total cross sectional area of filter intakes/outlets is kept constant. 
        (no bernoulli effect, all energy/pressure delta going to filtering friction/collision) 
        solution of the new cycloneFilter objects to the described rectangular prism.
        Stops when the rectangular prism is filled.

                init_params: list of cycloneFilter positional parameters to start from
                delta_params: list of values that will change each respective positional init_params
